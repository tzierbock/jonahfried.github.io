Who am I, I am Scottish school student at George Watson's College Ediburgh, I have studied Product Design, Graphic Communications and Fine Art. Outside of school I am a passionate artist and designer. I am very broad in my art studies.   

I have painted since the age of 13 in acrylic as well as oil but have only now got a good quantity of art to a standard which I am happy with. My art is mainly architectural but I have sadly not yet tried figurative art.

My subject matter is very wide, I conform to many influences my main artist influence being pre WW2 artist such as Anselm Kiefer, Cezanne  and Edward Hopper. They are all used in different ways throughout, I feel Kiefer's use of texture is commendable and Hoppers geometric style and architectural subject matter is superb.

I have had a small amount of experience in the world of work, I have only done about a week in total of work experience in Slovakia with my cousin in an advertising agency, he is a successful art director and has taught me the majority of my photoshop skills. I am mainly self taught in my photography. I use a D700 Nikon camera which is around a year old and it has never disappointed me. I use it for both photography and film. I have recently taken an amazing stills course in advanced street photography, it taught me ways to create a composition and built up confidence in taking photos of people in public. I have signed up to do a longer courses in lithography printing and also a separate course in life drawing.                  

My future plans are to do a foundation year in London or Manchester doing some type of art or design and then go onto study design at uni. I have ambitions to start up a design company or be a free lance designer but I have a long time till that comes about. 

The purpose of this website is to let people explore my work and to give feedback but also for people to contact if they are interested. If you haven't already seen the blog it is new but I intend on using it to keep people up to date.
